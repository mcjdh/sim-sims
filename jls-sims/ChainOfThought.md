# Chain of Thought

This document outlines the thought process for generating the JLS extracts.

## Step 1: Identify the core concepts

The first step is to identify the core concepts that need to be extracted from the JLS. This involves reading through the JLS and identifying the key terms, definitions, and examples.

## Step 2: Develop a set of extraction rules

Once the core concepts have been identified, the next step is to develop a set of extraction rules. These rules will be used to automatically extract the relevant information from the JLS.

## Step 3: Apply the extraction rules

The extraction rules are then applied to the JLS to extract the relevant information. This information is then stored in a structured format, such as a CSV file.

## Step 4: Review and refine the results

The extracted information is then reviewed and refined to ensure that it is accurate and complete. This may involve manually correcting any errors or omissions.

## Step 5: Generate the final output

Finally, the extracted information is used to generate the final output, such as a set of JLS extracts or a JLS cheat sheet.
