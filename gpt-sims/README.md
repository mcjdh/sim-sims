# GPT Sims Sandbox

This folder contains copies of a few standout simulations selected for experimentation. They are cloned from other parts of the repository for easier reference.

Included files:

- `gen08_consc.html` – ambitious attempt at a self-modifying "consciousness".
- `gen01_atten.html` – demonstrates attention mechanisms.
- `gen02_emerg.html` – shows elegant emergent behavior.
- `gen07_cosmi.html` – a poetic depiction of cosmic love.
- `slime_mold.html` – biologically inspired emergent networks.
- `gravity_well_playground.html` – interactive physics demo.

Feel free to modify these copies without affecting the originals.

## Common Controls

Most simulations now support:

- **Space** – pause/resume the animation
- **+ / -** – increase or decrease simulation speed
